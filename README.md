# VoteIndia
An app helping in an easy and cost effective way to conduct elections.
Things needed to be taken care of while building an application:
1. There should not be an iota of networking involved because involving connectivity will welcome conspiracies and the idea will get straight away rejected.
2. So the ideal idea should be to make an app that works exactly as the so called voting machine.
3. We can add connectivity if possible in a very strict manner to have a fast counting but that's the last thing as connectivity can welcome a great debate on it.
4. I thing the voting can be done the same way and not like Malaysian way where people can vote from there home. Doing the Malaysian way will lead to promote vote buying on a large scale even if we have made a good app.
5. The best of all way is to have a handy smartphone having OS like KAI OS which are less vulnerable to hacking or on a smartphone of Android or ios disabled with all possible kind of coonnectivity including OTG.
6. I will be making an app on React Native to have an app similar to that of voting machine.
7. Extra features of GPS can be used to track if the machine has not gone in wrong hands with GPS tracking will enhance security.
8.Features of displaying which party you have voted will replace VVPAT slips which shows on screen for some seconds and disappears.
